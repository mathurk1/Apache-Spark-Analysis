# WebServer Log Data


The data set we're using is an anonymized Web server log file. If you take a look at the file, you'll see that each line represents a hit to the Web server. It includes the IP address which accessed the site, the date and time of the access, and the name of the page which was visited.

The logfile is in Common Log Format:

Where:

%h is the IP address of the client
%l is identity of the client, or "-" if it's unavailable
%u is username of the client, or "-" if it's unavailable
%t is the time that the server finished processing the request. The format is [day/month/year:hour:minute:second zone]
